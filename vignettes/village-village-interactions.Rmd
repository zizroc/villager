# Village-Village Interaction

This vignette shows how interactions between villages is possible. This is done by exchanging agents between two villages.

## Scenario

This in scenario, there are two villages that each start with 10 agents. Each village will start with agents of different genders. Each day that passes, there's a small chance that an agent transfers to the other village. This can be thought of a simplified diffusion model.

## Initial Condition

### Village A

Village A starts with a female only population.

```{r}
initial_condition_a <- function(current_state, model_data, agent_mgr, resource_mgr) {
  for (i in 1:20) {
    test_agent <- villager::agent$new(gender="female", health=100)
    agent_mgr$add_agent(test_agent)
  }
}
```

### Village B

Village B starts with an only male population.

```{r}
initial_condition_b <- function(current_state, model_data, agent_mgr, resource_mgr) {
  for (i in 1:20) {
    test_agent <- villager::agent$new(gender="male", health=100)
    agent_mgr$add_agent(test_agent)
  }
}
```

## Models

To make things more interesting, each village will have a different model. The key points to note in this example is the use of the `village_mgr` object, which is used to transfer agents between villages. Another key aspect is that models are run within _village_ instances. This means that you can access the current village's identifier through `self$identifier`. This is used when iterating through the village_mgr to make sure you aren't interacting with the wrong village.

### Village A

Each day, there will be a 10% chance that a female agent moves to Village B

```{r}
village_a_model <- function(current_state, previous_state, model_data, agent_mgr, resource_mgr, village_mgr) {
  # Start by finding the pointer to Village B. Use the name of the village
  for (village in village_mgr$get_villages()) {
    if(village$name == "village_b")  {
        village_b <- village
    }
  }
  
  for (agent_to_move in agent_mgr$get_living_agents()) {
    if(agent_to_move$gender == 'female') {
      transfer_chance <- runif(1, 0, 10)
      if (transfer_chance >= 6) {
        # Add the agent to Village B
        village_b$agent_mgr$add_agent(agent_to_move)
        # Remove the agent from this village
        agent_mgr$remove_agent(agent_to_move$identifier)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Village B

Each day, there's a chance that a male agent moves to Village A.

```{r}
village_b_model <- function(current_state, previous_state, model_data, agent_mgr, resource_mgr, village_mgr) {
  # Start by finding the pointer to Village A. Use the name of the village
    for (village in village_mgr$get_villages()) {
    if(village$name == "village_a")  {
        village_a <- village
    }
  }
  
  for (agent_to_move in agent_mgr$get_living_agents()) {
    if(agent_to_move$gender == 'male') {
      transfer_chance <- runif(1, 0, 10)
      if (transfer_chance >= 6) {
        # Add the agent to Village A
        village_a$agent_mgr$add_agent(agent_to_move)
        # Remove the agent from this village
        agent_mgr$remove_agent(agent_to_move$identifier)
      }
    }
  }
}
```
## Running

Finally, we'll create and run a simulation with a duration of 10 days.

```{r}
village_a <- village$new(name="village_a", initial_condition_a, village_a_model)
village_b <- village$new(name="village_b", initial_condition_b, village_b_model)
simulator <- simulation$new(10, list(village_a, village_b))
simulator$run_model()
```

## Results

### Village A

Village A started will a population of all female agents. Over time, they moved to Village B, while the Village B male population moved to Village A.

```{r}
# Load data
village_a_agents <- readr::read_csv("results/village_a/agents.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

# Show number of agents of gender Female in Village A
print("Village A Female counts")
data_a<-village_a_agents[village_a_agents$step == 1, ]
print(nrow(data_a[data_a$gender == 'female', ]))
data_a<-village_a_agents[village_a_agents$step == 2, ]
print(nrow(data_a[data_a$gender == 'female', ]))
data_a<-village_a_agents[village_a_agents$step == 3, ]
print(nrow(data_a[data_a$gender == 'female', ]))
data_a<-village_a_agents[village_a_agents$step == 4, ]
print(nrow(data_a[data_a$gender == 'female', ]))
data_a<-village_a_agents[village_a_agents$step == 5, ]
print(nrow(data_a[data_a$gender == 'female', ]))
data_a<-village_a_agents[village_a_agents$step == 6, ]

# Show village A Male counts. 
print("Village A Male counts")
data_a<-village_a_agents[village_a_agents$step == 1, ]
print(nrow(data_a[data_a$gender == 'male', ]))
data_a<-village_a_agents[village_a_agents$step == 2, ]
print(nrow(data_a[data_a$gender == 'male', ]))
data_a<-village_a_agents[village_a_agents$step == 3, ]
print(nrow(data_a[data_a$gender == 'male', ]))
data_a<-village_a_agents[village_a_agents$step == 4, ]
print(nrow(data_a[data_a$gender == 'male', ]))
data_a<-village_a_agents[village_a_agents$step == 5, ]
print(nrow(data_a[data_a$gender == 'male', ]))
data_a<-village_a_agents[village_a_agents$step == 6, ]
```

### Village B

The opposite happens with Village B: It starts with only male agents and they move to Village A. The female agents from Village A move to B.

Note that Village A is run _before_ Village B. For this reason, the first time step for Village B will be mutated by Village A's first step.

```{r}
# Load data
village_b_agents <- readr::read_csv("results/village_b/agents.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
# Show number of agents of gender Female in Village B
print("Village B Female counts")
data_a<-village_b_agents[village_b_agents$step == 1, ]
print(nrow(data_a[data_a$gender == 'female', ]))
data_a<-village_b_agents[village_b_agents$step == 2, ]
print(nrow(data_a[data_a$gender == 'female', ]))
data_a<-village_b_agents[village_b_agents$step == 3, ]
print(nrow(data_a[data_a$gender == 'female', ]))
data_a<-village_b_agents[village_b_agents$step == 4, ]
print(nrow(data_a[data_a$gender == 'female', ]))
data_a<-village_b_agents[village_b_agents$step == 5, ]
print(nrow(data_a[data_a$gender == 'female', ]))
data_a<-village_b_agents[village_b_agents$step == 6, ]

# Show village B Male counts. 
print("Village B Male counts")
data_a<-village_b_agents[village_b_agents$step == 1, ]
print(nrow(data_a[data_a$gender == 'male', ]))
data_a<-village_b_agents[village_b_agents$step == 2, ]
print(nrow(data_a[data_a$gender == 'male', ]))
data_a<-village_b_agents[village_b_agents$step == 3, ]
print(nrow(data_a[data_a$gender == 'male', ]))
data_a<-village_b_agents[village_b_agents$step == 4, ]
print(nrow(data_a[data_a$gender == 'male', ]))
data_a<-village_b_agents[village_b_agents$step == 5, ]
print(nrow(data_a[data_a$gender == 'male', ]))
data_a<-village_b_agents[village_b_agents$step == 6, ]
```

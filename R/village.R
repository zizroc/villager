#' @docType class
#' @description This is an object that represents the state of a village at a particular time.
#' @details This class acts as a type of record that holds the values of the different village variables. This class can be subclassed
#' to include more variables that aren't present.
#' @field name An optional name for the village
#' @field initial_condition A function that sets the initial state of the village
#' @field StateRecords A list of state objects, one for each time step
#' @field tradePartners A list of villages that this village can trade with
#' @field models A list of functions or a single function that should be run at each timestep
#' @field model_data Optional data that models may need
#' @field winik_mgr The manager that handles all of the winiks
#' @field resource_mgr The manager that handles all of the resources
